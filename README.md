Personal blog

# Description

This a tiny personal blog static website built with React.js as an assignment at school in frontend technologies. Inspite of having so much inspiartion for the app, I only managed to finish the landing page. Still, you can enjoy. This app uses no CSS framework and was entirely built with pure CSS on top of SASS.
